# Overview

1. The paper emphasizes the need to consider the hidden impacts of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in low-income countries, which are often overlooked in conservation policies. These hidden impacts include those that are uncompensated, delayed, or psychosocial in nature.

2. The study identifies a variety of hidden impacts, such as diminished psychosocial wellbeing, disruption of livelihoods, food insecurity, and considerable opportunity costs incurred through crop and livestock guarding.

3. Bureaucratic inadequacies in compensation processes for damage result in additional transaction costs for affected communities.

4. Despite community tolerance towards wildlife, these hidden impacts of HWC can jeopardize various components of global wellbeing.

5. The paper concludes by identifying gaps in the current understanding of HWC's hidden dimensions and suggests areas for future research to address these issues more effectively.
