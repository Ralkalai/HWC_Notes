# Overview

- 1. The paper introduces a conceptual model that adopts a social-ecological systems approach to address the challenges of aligning data types and communicating across disciplines when studying human-wildlife interactions. 

2. This model acknowledges multiple levels of influence on both human and animal behavior and accounts for the various feedback mechanisms between social and ecological systems, thus treating social and ecological processes with equal depth.

3. The authors use human-black bear conflicts in Colorado, USA, as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, providing insights and guidelines for applying this integrated approach to other human-wildlife systems.

# Theoretical Framework
- Figure describing the framework that attempts to integrate SES logic to the study of HWI
- The figure aims to use HWI as the intersection point of these two systems - HWI is the interface of this process

>"In the simplest form, HWIs can be conceptualized as the result of two distinct, but interacting systems: social and ecological (Fig. 1a).  Although human and animal behaviors are the proximate drivers of HWIs, the context shaping those behaviors is defined by multiple, nested levels of external social and ecological influences (Fig. 1b) and attributes of individual humans and animals (Fig. 1c). When viewed through a single disciplinary lens, these systems may appear to operate independently; however, the ecological and social systems often overlap spatially, and feedbacks among social and ecological drivers (represented by curved arrows in Fig. 1b) are critical determinants of HWIs." -- P81

# Lessons Learned from the Study
## Lesson 1: Integrate social science throughout the research process
- “The success of integrated approaches to understanding and mana- ging HWIs is dependent on the extent to which they adequately address social factors (Dickman, 2010), yet wildlife research and management typically focus on actions that modify animal populations (Morzillo et al., 2014)” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 84)
- “Even when social and ecological scientists collectively design re- search objectives, teams often separate into discipline-specific groups to collect and analyze data and disseminate results.” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 84)
## Lesson 2: Align the scale of social and ecological data
- “The default extent and resolution of data collected in social and ecological studies often do not match, leading to difficulties in in- tegrating findings across data types (Heemskerk et al., 2003; Pooley et al., 2014).” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 84)
- “However, financial and logistical constraints hampered our ability to execute the experiment at this scale, primarily due to the large size of bear home ranges and the high cost of bear-resistant containers. As a result, our bear-proofing study was constrained to track the effect of the new containers on conflict rates and human behaviors within the core residential area of” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “In addition to aligning the spatial extent of our measures of human and animal behavior, we also modified our plans to assess the motivations for bear-proofing behavior.” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “Efforts such as these that match the scale and resolution of data types prior to the start of data collection can overcome common challenges of SES research and yield greater opportunities for integration of results (Pooley et al., 2014).” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
## Lesson 3: Conservation means human and animal behavior
- “In his influential paper, Conservation Means Behavior, Schultz (2011) argued that conservation success is dependent on efforts to understand and affect human behavior. W” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “Wildlife managers have often used rates of HWIs as an indicator of the size of wildlife populations (Morzillo et al., 2014). Consequently, management actions to reduce conflict, such as increased harvest, are frequently aimed at decreasing wildlife population size. Unfortunately, these efforts are rarely successful as conflict rates do not necessarily reflect numerical changes in populations (Treves et al., 2010; Obbard et al., 2014), particularly when animals shift their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions (Wong and Candolin, 2015)” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “Similarly, social science research on HWIs could benefit from greater attention to quantifying individual human behaviors. Data collection in this area has often relied on passive means of behavioral assessment, including surveys of behavioral intentions or self-reported activities as proxies for actual behavior (Baumeister et al., 2007). While these methods are cost-efficient and can be used to collect info” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)

# Conclusion
- “This is typical of other HWI systems, where attempts to simultaneously examine both human and animal drivers are rare (Dickman, 2010).” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “We realized that we could not fully evaluate the efficacy of a bear-proofing effort by only tracking changes in human-bear interactions. To more completely assess the effectiveness of changes in waste management practices, we needed to also investigate the importance of natural food conditions, resident compliance with the city bear-proofing ordinance, and the factors motivating those behaviors.” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 85)
- “We recommend applying this model to other assessments of HWIs to guide interdisciplinary communication and research efforts that can more adequately address the complex and dynamic nature of human- wildlife relationships.” (Lischka et al., 2018, p. 86)
