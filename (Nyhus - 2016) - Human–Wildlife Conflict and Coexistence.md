# Theoretical Framework

## 1.1 Defining HWCC
-   Human-wildlife conflict is described as adverse interactions between people and wildlife that may involve threats to human life, economic security, or recreation.
-   The conflict can also stem from the perception that wildlife threatens human safety, health, food, and property.
-   "Wildlife" is generally defined as nondomesticated plants and animals in the context of human-wildlife conflict.
-   However, domesticated and feral animals are sometimes included in discussions and literature on human-wildlife conflict.

## 1.2 Importance of HWCC
- Direct impacts of Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) on humans include injuries, fatalities, and transmission of zoonotic diseases through animal attacks, collisions with vehicles, and exposure to parasites.
- Indirect impacts of HWC on humans encompass economic losses from damage to crops, livestock, and property, as well as opportunity costs for farmers and rangers who need to protect their resources. Additionally, HWC can lead to reduced psychosocial well-being, disruption of livelihoods, and food insecurity.
# 2 - Conflict in Evolutionary and Historical Perspective
- Human evolution has been significantly marked by continuous competition with other species -- wildlife
- Kingdoms and colonial empires often supported predator eradication efforts because of the danger posed by wild animals.
	- Tigers in China
	- Wolves in US and Europe
-   Throughout history, human populations have competed with wildlife, often leading to the eradication or reduction of wildlife populations and species that posed significant threats, while attempting to minimize damage from surviving species.
-   However, in recent decades, there has been a shift towards a coexistence model and conservation efforts, driven by increased awareness of the value of biodiversity, improved information, tools, laws, institutions, and changing values, promoting more innovative wildlife management approaches.

# 3 -  Conflict types and locations
## 3.1. Large Terrestrial and Amphibious Species
### 3.1.1 Carnivores
- People around the world have expressed deep hostility toward large carnivores because of real and perceived impacts on human health and livelihoods (6, 32).
-   The abundance of  carnivores is influenced by prey availability, and increasing livestock density can potentially escalate human-wildlife conflict (33).
-   At least two dozen species of terrestrial carnivores globally are known to prey on nine common species of livestock.
-   Over 75% of the world's feline species are impacted by human-wildlife conflict, with the severity of conflict generally escalating with increasing body mass.
### 3.1.2 Herbivores and Omnivores
-   Around 60% of the world’s 74 largest terrestrial herbivore species (body mass ≥ 100 kg) are at risk of extinction, which carries significant implications for other species and ecosystem processes.
-   Large vertebrate herbivores can create conflict with humans by trampling, directly consuming, and causing damage to vegetation of both ecological and socioeconomic importance.
-   These conflicts underscore the complex challenges of managing human-wildlife interactions, particularly with species that have substantial ecological impacts.
- Bears, Rhinos, Elephants, and Boars are the primary species of conflict
## 3.2 Agricultural Pests
- Agricultural pests, biological organisms that are considered harmful to crops or livestock (41), are leading causes of agricultural damage.
- Many agricultural pests are invasive species, including starlings, and hundreds of species, including 92 birds and 32 mammals, are considered exotic in North America alone (8).
- In 2014, the US Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Service dispersed or harassed approximately 28 million animals and “took” (i.e., killed) 2.7 million animals. Of those taken, 57% were non-native European starlings, house sparrows, and pigeons or blackbirds (43).
## 3.3 Feral Animals
- Dogs and cats can cause conflict through predation on other wildlife, disease transmission, wildlife disturbance, hybridization, and direct attacks on livestock and people.
- Dogs are responsible for 99% of the reported 55,000 annual human fatalities due to rabies (46).
- In the United States, free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 1.3–4 billion birds and 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually (45)
## 3.4 Marine Species
- Marine conflict can take many forms, including direct attacks, bites, stings, and collisions, as well as impacts related to pollution, removal and modification of natural habitat, resource extraction, tourism and recreation, entanglement with fishing gear, and other harvesting activities (51, 52).
- In an analysis of four decades of human-caused whale mortality in the Northwest Atlantic, Van Der Hoop et al. (52) documented 1,762 cases of human-caused mortality and serious injury involving eight species of whales.
- Mortality from harvesting led to historic global whale population declines, but deaths from collisions constitute a continuing threat (54).
## 3.5 Disease Transmission 
- Many wildlife species are reservoirs for pathogens, and zoonotic and vector-borne diseases pose considerable risks to livestock, human, and wildlife health (55).
- Approximately 60% of all globally emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic diseases that infect both humans and animals (57), and 72% originate in wildlife (56).
- Disease can also influence how animals behave, contributing to additional conflict. An estimated 350 pathogens, including rabies virus, canine distemper virus, and canine parvovirus, can infect dog populations and threaten both wolf and wild dog populations (44, 47).
- The majority of documented cases of wolf attacks on people in twentieth-century Europe were attributed to rabid wolves (58).
