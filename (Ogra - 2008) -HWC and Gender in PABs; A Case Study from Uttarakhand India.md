# Overview
1. The paper explores Human–wildlife conflict (HWC) in communities near protected areas, focusing on an agricultural village near Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand, India. It investigates the visible and hidden costs of such conflicts, examining how these costs are perceived and divided between men and women.

2. The research was conducted via surveys and interviews with over 100 individuals, carried out over nine months in 2003-2004.

3. The study found that HWC results in a range of effects, including decreased food security, altered workload, reduced physical and psychological wellbeing, economic hardship, and in some cases, increased illegal or dangerous activities.

4. While women bore a disproportionate burden of these effects, about half of the survey respondents believed that men and women were equally affected, pointing to a potential discrepancy between perception and reality.

5. The study emphasizes the importance of considering both visible and hidden costs of HWC, and calls for more gender-sensitive research in the field of HWC.
# Theoretical Framework
- “I define hidden costs as those characterized by one or more of the following traits: (a) uncompensated, (b) temporally delayed, or (c) psychologi- cal or social in nature.” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,409)
- “This paper argues that hidden costs of HWC often go unnoticed in part because they are gen- dered. To illustrate this point, I employ a framework for analyzing both the visible and hidden costs of HWC by drawing on critical theories of the household and recent work in feminist political ecology.” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,409)

- The paper outlines two frameworks to assess the explicit and hidden costs of HWC in particular
- The first one indicates the assessment of crop-raiding events

- The second framework outlines the explicit and hidden costs of an attack/ encounter event

# Methodology

- “With the help of native Hindi- and Garhwali-speaking research assistants,5 I conducted over 100 open-ended and survey-based interviews about HWC. The surveys were used to quantify and describe villagers’ perceptions of the frequency, intensity, location, and nature of HWC at vil- lage, household, and individual levels.” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,411)
- “Due to male out-migration, it was not possible to find an equal number of men available to par- ticipate without returning to households that had already been approached. In all, we administered 70 surveys (40 women and 30 men” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,412)
- “I then hand-coded each interview transcript and associated set of notes, creating a master list of key and recurrent themes as part of an indexed text-based dataset (e.g., as described in Denizen and Lincoln, 2000; LeCompte and Schensul, 1999). In this way, I was able to categorize clusters of spe- cific types of responses to general questions about HWC and easily locate representative narrative text for specific survey questions” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,412)

# Results

## 4.1 Visible costs of crop-raiding
- “Participants reported uncompensated ‘‘visible” costs including loss of crops, damage to fields, and various other forms of property damage such as broken fencing or water pipes. A variety of protected animals, including elephant, wild boar, and various ungulate and avian species, were reported to routinely move across the invisible park bound- aries in search of food, which they find in abundance in the fields of Bhalalogpur” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,412)
- “Due to a contiguous spatial arrangement of village landholdings, lack of intra-village fencing, and proximity to the park boundary, both large and small landowning families share potential vulnerabil- ity. With only raised bunds or irrigation ditches demarcat- ing divisions between landholdings, elephants tend to cause damage across many households’ fields during any given event” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,413)
## 4.2. Hidden costs of crop-raiding by elephants
- “Crop-raiding events often led to a series of hidden costs for villagers in the study. Such costs include increased workloads and diminished physical wellbeing, especially for women.” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,413)
- “A commonly overlooked set of outcomes associated with crop-raiding involves an increased workload for both men and women” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,413)
- “These data suggest that women are equally likely to be involved in guarding activities and bear the attendant physical risks” (Ogra, 2008, pp. 1,414)
## 4.3. Visible costs of attack by elephants
- “The most visible consequences of attacks reported by study participants include death and injury. All respondents agreed that elephant attacks are a problem for villagers, though perception of frequency varied across sub-categories. (Table 4).” (Ogra, 2008, p. 1414)
- “Despite these women’s specialized knowledge of the forest and awareness of conditions that signal danger, they continue to occupy such hazardous sites. Here, the mother’s friend attributes the accident to forces of destiny or fate, with death as the principal responsible actor, rather than to the material (e.g., economic) or cultural (e.g., genderbased) conditions that placed the women in the forest to begin with. Women frequently employed such explanations. As one woman reminded me, ‘‘One may die sitting at home! These are only excuses. Death may come in any way.” In this context, visible costs may remain hidden from even those directly involved.” (Ogra, 2008, p. 1415)
## 4.4. Hidden costs of attack by elephants
- “Hidden costs of elephant attack include fear, economic hardship and/or increased workload. Over 90% of respondents said that they feel afraid when they leave the village boundaries and enter the forest.” (Ogra, 2008, p. 1415)
- “Elephant encounters may also result in economic loss even when no one is killed or injured. For example, women who encounter elephants during fuelwood/fodder collection may be forced to abandon their bundles and return to the village.” (Ogra, 2008, p. 1416)
