# Overview

1. The paper highlights that research has predominantly focused on the negative aspects of human-wildlife interactions, labeling them as conflicts. This is supported by their analysis of the ISI Web of Knowledge database, which showed that 71% of research is centered around conflict, with only 2% on coexistence and 8% on neutral interactions.

2. Such a framing can lead to biases in conservation planning by failing to consider the complexities of people's relationships with wildlife and the potential opportunities for conservation.

3. The authors propose a typology of human responses to wildlife impacts, ranging from negative to positive, to provide a more balanced perspective and lessen the emphasis on conflict.

4. Standardizing terminology and considering a broader range of interactions, beyond just the negative ones, can lead to a more nuanced understanding of human-wildlife relations and help promote greater coexistence.

5. The paper also lists and classifies the influential factors that shape human-wildlife interactions into 55 proximate (correlates) and five ultimate (mechanisms) factors to further stimulate research and hypothesis generation.

# Theoretical Framework
- Below is the typology of classification for determining the framework/conceptualization used by the authors of the papers to categorize the HWI perspective

- Based on this typology (above) -- the human responses to wildlife conflict have been shown to be the following when categorized across 2 axis (Behaviour and Attitude)

- The authors show the proximate drivers inside the circles and the causal drivers as the overarching category

# Methodology

 1. The research employed the ISI Web of Knowledge database to find articles on human-wildlife interactions using a set of specific keywords. The search produced a total of 844 results spanning 1991-2017.
2. The 250 most recent articles (from September 2015 to July 2017) were selected for further analysis to better reflect current understandings of human-wildlife relationships.
3. Each article was categorized according to its main focus using a pre-established typology. Two coders initially analysed 100 of the articles, achieving an 80% inter-coder agreement.
4. Any disagreements in categorization were resolved by a third party, identified as SB.
5. Based on the analysis, the team identified a variety of human responses to wildlife impacts, building on previous models of persuasion like Value-Attitude-Behaviour, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Theory of Planned Behaviour.
6. It was concluded that attitude and behaviour together form a response, with both elements making up definitions of tolerance and intolerance towards wildlife. Several different interpretations of these terms from various sources were considered.
7. The research also identified factors influencing human attitudes and behaviours towards wildlife, using a combination of a literature review and an unstructured review of key papers and concepts from the selected articles.

# Results & Discussion
- “Five types of human responses emerged from our review (Fig. ): () manifested intolerance, in which negative attitudes translated into negative behaviours, ()latent intolerance, in which negative attitudes did not translate into negative behaviours, () neutral or ambivalent attitudes, which did not translate into negative or positive behaviours, () appreciation, in which positive attitudes did not translate into positive behaviours, and ()stewardship, in which positive attitudes translated into positive behaviours.” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 623)
- “The 55 factors that we identified were considered proximate factors or correlates because they were pattern-oriented rather than cause-oriented. For example, gender, a proximate factor, may influence human responses to wildlife, but by itself it does not help us understand why a particular gender should have a negative or positive response towards wild animals.” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 624)
- “The five ultimate factors identified in the study were value orientation, social interactions, resource dependence, perceptions of risk and nature of interaction with the animal.” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 624)
## Breaking down the 5 ultimate factors/causal factors (FIG 2)
- “Value orientation can be understood as a preferred organization of beliefs that mediates an individual’s relationship with society and the environment (Kluckhohn, ).” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 624)
- “Social interactions refer to the extent of cooperation, faith and confidence between the individual and the community, and between the community and conservation agencies, when dealing with wildlife impacts.” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 624)
- “Resource dependence has a direct bearing on the economic and psychological costs of living with wildlife. If a significant proportion of time, labour and money has been invested in a resource that is perceived to be in competition with the needs of wildlife, then an individual is likely to have a more negative response towards wildlife (Gadd, ; Karlsson & Sjöstrom, ; Humle & Hill, ).” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 625)
- “Gore et al. () suggested two predominant types of influences on people’s perceptions of risk from wildlife: personal/individual capacity to control, and agency capacity. The former includes factors such as personal volition, perceived probability of exposure to risk, frequency and intensity of exposure, predictability and ability to control the risk, knowledge about the risk, and affect (Dorresteijn et al., ;Pontetal.,).” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 626)
- “The nature of interaction with the animal is the setting in which people encounter wildlife. Some specific factors that define people’s interactions include the action, target, context and time (Fishbein & Ajzen, ).” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 626)
- “Proximate factors such as age, gender, education and the hidden costs of living with damage-causing species work through multiple pathways (Fig. ). For example, people’s perception of risk, their resource dependence and their value orientations may differ depending on their age, gender and level of education (Koziarski et al., ;Manfredo et al., ). Similarly, the hidden costs of human–wildlife interactions will affect perceptions of risk and resource dependence of individuals (Humle & Hill, ).” (Bhatia et al., 2020, p. 626)
